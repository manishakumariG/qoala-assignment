Implement rolling updates for the application.

To implement rolling updates for your application in Kubernetes, you need to update the Deployment resource with the new version of your application container image. Kubernetes will then handle the rolling update process automatically. Here's how you can do it:

Update the Deployment YAML File:
Modify the spec.template.spec.containers[].image field in your Deployment YAML file to specify the new version of your application container image.
yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:2.0  # Update the image version to the new version
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
Apply the Updated Deployment YAML File:
Use kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml to apply the updated Deployment YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster.
bash

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
Monitor the Rolling Update:
Kubernetes will automatically start rolling out the new version of your application while gracefully terminating the old pods.
You can monitor the progress of the rolling update using kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment.


kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
Verify the Rolling Update:
Once the rolling update is complete, verify that the new version of your application is running as expected using kubectl get pods.



kubectl get pods
By following these steps, Kubernetes will handle the rolling update process for your application, ensuring zero downtime and minimizing disruptions to your users. Adjust the YAML file according to your specific application and environment requirements.
