Implement a process to automatically scale EC2 instances based on CPU utilization.
AWS autoscaling will scale the application based on the load of application. Instead of scaling manually AWS auto scaling will scale the application automatically when the incoming traffic is high it will scale up the application and when the traffic is low it will scale down the application.
We can achieve the scalling using the CPU metrics provided by CloudWatch Monitoring.

First you should choose which service or an application you want to scale then select the optimisation way like cost and performance and then keep track how the scaling is working.
Steps To create Auto Scaling Launch Template
Step 1: Click on the All Services.
Step 2: Click on the EC2(Elastic Cloud Computing).
Step 3: Scroll Down and click on the Launch Templates and click on the Create launch template
Step 4: Type the Template name.
Step 5: Select the Amazon Machine Image.
Step 6: Select the Instance Type and Key pair.
Step 7: Select the Security Group or Create the new one.
Step 8: Click on the Create Launch Template. 
Step 9: Now you can see the template is created. Now, scroll down and click on the Auto Scaling Groups.

 
Create An Auto Scaling Group Using a Launch Template
Step 1: Click on the Create Auto Scaling group. 
Step 2: Type the Auto Scaling group name.
Step 3: Select your Template.
Step 4: Select the VPC or go with the default VPC and also select the Availability zone.

Step 5: Configure the Group size and Scaling policies.
Select as per your requirement:
Desired: 4
Minimum: 4
Maximum: 8

Step 6: Select the Target tracking scaling policy.
Step 7: Click on the Create Auto Scaling Group.

Now you can see the Auto Scaling is creating and it is also creating the desired state of the EC2 Instance
We selected the Desired state equal to 4 and you can see the 4 Instance is Running


Thus, we can see that based on Average CPU utilization, the EC2 instance with scale up/down without any intervention.
